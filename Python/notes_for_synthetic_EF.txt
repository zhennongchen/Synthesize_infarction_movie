Patient set: 94 patients

Data/Movie set: 
for each patient, use time_0_segmentation as the template, generate 10 normal LV function 
(random EF between 70-90) and 10 abnormal LV function (random EF between 10-30)
All deformation are linear and uniform.
Each surface rendering movie has 20 time frames as one cardiac cycle.
result in 20 * 94 = 1880 movies

Training/Test split:
67 patients and 67*20 = 1440 movies in Training
27 patients and 27*20 = 540 movies in Test

Network Design:
Extract features from each time frame picture by InceptionV3.
Combine all features from 20 time frames, resulting in (20,2048) features.
then use combined-features as input for LSTM to output two classess (normal vs. abnormal)

Hyperparameter choice:
learning rate = 1e-5 and decay = 1e-6 for adam optimizer
batch size = 32
epoch = 100

Result:
trainig_accuracy achieves 1 at epoch 44
validation_accuracy achieves highest value as 0.98 at epoch 31.
