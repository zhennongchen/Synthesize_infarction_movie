Patient set: 93 patients

Data/Movie set: 
for each patient, use time_0_segmentation as the template, generate n severe (reduction = 70-80%),
n mild (reduction = 40-60%) and n normal (reduction = 0-20%) infarction. All deformation are linear and uniform.
Each surface rendering movie has 20 time frames as one cardiac cycle.
result in n * 94  movies

Training/Test split:
66 patients in Training
27 patients in Test

Network Design:
Extract features from each time frame picture by InceptionV3.
Combine all features from 20 time frames, resulting in (20,2048) features.
then use combined-features as input for LSTM to output three classess (severe, mild, normal)

Hyperparameter choice:
batch size = 32
epoch = 150

Test result:
lstm:
n = 4, learning_rate = 1e-5, learning_decay = 1e-6, trainig acc = 0.788 at epoch 135, val_acc = 0.774 at epoch 143 

lstm2:
n = 4, learning_rate = 1e-4, learning_decay = 1e-5, trainig acc = 0.919 at epoch 144, val_acc = 0.805 at epoch 140
